description = """Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) are a set of cross-platform command line programs that implement algorithms for analyzing and working with Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® arrays. APT is an open-source project licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). (Developers who need a non-GPL license may purchase a commercial license from Affymetrix.) APT programs are intended for "power users" who prefer programs that can be utilized in scripting environments and are sophisticated enough to handle the complexity of extra features and functionality. The vision is that APT provides a platform for developing and deploying new algorithms without waiting for the GUI implementations."""
